## The Problems
- The chiefmost problem is the number of options that the user has.
  - First option: the "buttons" in the leftmost column, which are really just empty panels that they didnt' use
  - Second option: the button where actual number is. You can see that this is another frequented option by how 
    the paint is slightly peeled on the most common floors, 1 and 1R.
  - Third, and the correct, option: the thin panel next to the number. 
  
- The Second biggest problem is how the actual correct option is the least likely one to be chosen.
  - The correct button to select a floor is literally the smallest of all the options
  - The correct button looks like it could just be the sliver that lights up when you hit the button, not the 
    button itself
 - Final Problem is the shape and alignment of buttons
   - Because all of the shapes and buttons are huddled together nothing intutuively distinguishes the right button 
    from the rest
    
## Common Elevator Use Cases and Feedback
- The Ground Floor
  - The most common use case is taking the elevator to the first floor because most of the time, you are going
    to have to use the elevator to leave the area again.
  - The only helpful thing the elevator does to suggest what the correct button to press would be is having the
    button be translucent, which even then could be construed as it just being a light for the actual button.
  - The elevator, like most others, has the standard feedback of having the floor lit after you've pressed it 
    and making a sound when you've pressed it.
  - The most common mistake, as seen by the peeled bottom floor buttons, is pushing the wrong panels trying to
    find the right button
    
## Suggestions for Fixing the Elevator
 - Get rid of the leftmost column next to the floors, this will outright remove one of the wrong options
 - Move the bottom left two buttons such that everything is in 2 rows, leaving less confusion as to what is
   usable and what isn't.
 - Either change the shape of the floor number panel and the button to circles or just have the reactangular 
   floor number be the actual button, as these are two very standard setups.
