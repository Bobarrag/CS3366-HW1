- The chiefmost problem is the number of options that the user has.
  - First option, the "buttons" in the leftmost column, which are really just empty panels that they didnt' use
  - Second option, the button where actual number is. You can see that this is another frequented option by how 
    the paint is slightly peeled on the most common floors, 1 and 1R.
