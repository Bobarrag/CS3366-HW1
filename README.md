## The Elevator

## The Problems
- The chiefmost problem is the number of options that the user has.
  - First option: the "buttons" in the leftmost column, which are really just empty panels that they didnt' use
  - Second option: the button where actual number is. You can see that this is another frequented option by how 
    the paint is slightly peeled on the most common floors, 1 and 1R.
  - Third, and the correct, option: the thin panel next to the number. 
  
- The Second biggest problem is how the actual correct option is the least likely one to be chosen.
  - The correct button to select a floor is literally the smallest of all the options
  - The correct button looks like it could just be the sliver that lights up when you hit the button, not the 
    button itself
 - Final Problem is the shape and alignment of buttons
  - Because all of the shapes and buttons are huddled together nothing intutuively distinguishes the right button 
    from the rest
